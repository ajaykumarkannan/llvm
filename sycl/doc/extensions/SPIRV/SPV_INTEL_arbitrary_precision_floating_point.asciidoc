|========================================

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.5, Revision 2.

This extension depends on the SPV_INTEL_arbitrary_precision_int spec.

== Overview

_ihc_float_ is a datatype represented in SPIR-V using `OpTypeInt` that implements arbitrary precision floating point support.
This datatype and its corresponding operations can be useful on targets that can take advantage of narrower representation such as FPGAs.

The datatype is additionally described with two parameters:

* _E_: represents the number of exponent bits
* _M_: represents the number of mantissa bits

The total width of the type is `E+M+1` where the last bit is used to represent the sign.
Note that the signedness capabilities of `OpTypeInt` are not used for any of the operations.
The data layout is shown below:

`[ S (sign bit) ][ E (Exponent) ][ M (Mantissa) ]`

The width of the data `(E+M+1)` is encoded with the width of the `OpTypeInt`.
The other parameters regarding the type (namely `E` and `M`) are encoded within each of the signature of the operations.

=== Operation Controls

Each of the operations will also provide some control over the _Rounding Mode_ and the _Subnormal support_.
`OpTypeInt` literals are used to map to the various modes.

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification Version 1.5

After Section 3.16, add a new section "3.16a Subnormal Support" as follows:

=== Subnormal Support

Control whether subnormal support is enabled or not.

[options="header"]
[width="60%"]
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====
| Value ^| Subnormal Support (`OpTypeInt`)
| 0 | Flush subnormals numbers to zero on inputs and outputs
| 1 | Enable support for operating on subnormal numbers
|====

After Section 3.16, add a new section "3.16d Rounding Accuracy" as follows:

=== Rounding Accuracy

Controls whether rounding operations can be relaxed to trade correctness for improved resource utilization.

[options="header"]
[width="80%"]
[cols="15%,20%,65%"]
|====
| Value ^| Mode     ^| Behavior
| 0      | CORRECT   | Conform to the IEEE-754 standard for rounding accuracy
| 1      | FAITHFUL  | Allow some tolerance for error (within 1ULP of the IEEE-754 standard) for rounding. +
The returned result is one of the two floating point values closest to the mathematical result.

This mode is useful for devices that can trade CORRECT rounding for improved resource utilization.
